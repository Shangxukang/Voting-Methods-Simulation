Voting Method Recommendation for an Island with 2000 Inhabitants

This project explores the recommendation of a voting method for an island with 2000 inhabitants who have never experienced a "presidential" election before. By modeling the voting process, the analysis demonstrates that Approval Voting is the most suitable method for the island's circumstances.

For detailed modeling procedures and explanations, please refer to the Voting Method Recommendation file.
